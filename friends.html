            <h2>Best cooking in Town</h2>
            <p>The Villads Society would like to acknowledge and show our love to some of our friends. We're not officially partnered with any of the mentioned individuals, though we are very thankful for their contributions to the universe. First we'd like to show our love and support to a website that can arguably be considered to have the best cooking recipes in the entirety of Denmark. The website is none other than <a href="https://www.preus.dk" target="_blank">preus.dk</a>. For you English speakers out there, we can highly recommend Preus' "Book of John 1" - and more specifically the "Tower of Smoked Salmon"... It. Is. Delicious!</p>

            <h2>Fanpage on YouTube</h2>
            <p>Here at The Villads Society we are proud to announce that we have our very own fanpage! The fanpage is a YouTube channel dedicated to generating entertainment for generations to come. We're not officially affiliated with this page, although we can definitely recommend checking it out. Simply put, it's the peak of all entertainment, and it has never disappointed. The channel can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@villadsfrede/featured" target="_blank">here</a>. It is not known who runs the channel, although they're definitely worthy of The Villads Society's recognition.</p>
