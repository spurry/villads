            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Villads Society is an international collection of individuals who strive towards a common goal. To restore the pigeon society to its former glory. To create a world where humans and pigeons are one again equal. Now, this might seem like a farfetched idea. But there existed a time where it wasn’t. The Villads Society, as modern as it sounds is actually rooted in ancient traditions practiced by the still largely unknown globe-spanning pigeon society. A team of researchers funded by the society have sought to understand and uncover the secrets behind this civilization of the old world.</p>
            <p>Attached below is a report containing their current understanding of the Pigeon Civilization.</p>

            <h2>What is the pigeon society?</h2>
            <p>Author: I.M.Meen</p>
            <p>Co-author: L. O. Ser</p>
            <h2>Chapter 1: Genesis</h2>
            <p>The first known origins of the pigeon society date back to the ancient city of Pigeoné. The city of Pigeoné was located in the province of Jutlandia within the country of Markeden, a country located in the south of the Old World. Pigeoné was a major trade city, where products such as ivory feathers and bread were exported. Not much is known about Pigeon society pre-Pigeoné but there is evidence suggesting that Pigeoné was founded by a Pigeon god known as Pigetion.</p>
            <h2>Chapter 2: The society of the Pigeons</h2>
            <p>The society of the Pigeons was very complex, unlike humans, it wasn’t based on hierarchy. In Pigeon society the social status of Pigeon was based on chance. When a Pigeon was hatched from an egg, they were put through a process known as “the Pigeoning,” this process was used to determine the status of the newly hatched Pigeon. Very little is known about the Pigeoning.</p>
            <h2>Chapter 3: Pigeon infrastructure</h2>
            <p>The Pigeons had infrastructure that differs from human infrastructure, as Pigeons, like their descendants, had the gift of flight, meaning that infrastructure such as roads weren’t needed. Pigeons had their own logistics system known as Pigeonation, this logistics system was based on the Pigeons ability to fly, which is why in the Pigeonation system the Pigeons transported their goods on the backs of flying Pigeons. The usage of the Pigeonation system shows the brutality of pigeon society, as what is suspected to have been war captives were turned into chattel slaves for the economic purposes of the Pigeoné society. </p>
            <h2>Chapter 4: Pigeon culture</h2>
            <p>The Pigeon society had an intriguing culture as can been seen in the titles given to pigeons throughout their lifespans, where the first pigeon born in each month of the year was assigned the role of “Pigeenator.” The Pigeenators duties consisted of tracking ceremonial events. Due to their important role with the priestly class of society, the Pigeenators had a better chance within the Pigeoning compared to other sects of pigeon society. Within pigeon society the most important festivals were: “The Feathery Festival,” which was held every full moon. During the festival pigeons would drink wine made from grapes of the Taiga. The most important ceremony within pigeon society was “The Meta Gathering of the First Pigeon,” which was held to honor the first pigeon and founder of Pigeoné: Pigetion. During the ceremony, pigeons would pour the liquid of murdered children from other bird races into a golden goblet and pray to Pigetion.</p>
            <h2>Chapter 5: Summary</h2>
            <p>Pigeon society was an ancient society of pigeons and though little is known about them, what is known is their brutality which has made their legacy linger into the present. Though their society was very different from humans this should not be a counterfactor to judging the crimes of ancient civilizations from a modern view.</p>
