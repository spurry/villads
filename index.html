            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Today The Villads Society is engaged in many facets of society from pigeon racing to pigeon breeding. What started as a humble group of members has turned into a continent spanning society. Our mission is to further the keeping of pigeons. We believe that these animals will play an important part in our future. We need their help as much as they need ours. Therefore, are we today engaged in building the pigeon society of tomorrow.</p>
